# Speech Processing Labs: How to use these notebooks

This repository is used by me, Henry Heyden, as I follow along with this course :)

This repository includes phon lab instructions and signals lab notebooks for the University of Edinburgh course: Speech Processing (LASC11158/LASC10061). 


See the [How to Start](sp-m0-how-to-start.ipynb) notebook for instructions for getting set up! 

The course website can be found on the [Speech Zone website](http://speech.zone/courses/speech-processing/)
